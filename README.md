# DailyFantasySports

This repo is doing daily fantasy sports optimization based on numberfire projections.

It is admittedly not very accurate, but based on the projections that I used (NumberFire), these would build the optimal lineups Using binary maximization of projected points

Max Total Points
s.t.
  Have the correct amount of players (used a <= b/c it is a max, it will push to the 9 player threshold)
  Cost
  Needs to have every position
  
 I was able to use this in Daily Fantasy Sports in 2019, and it made me a net $4. The biggest problem with this is that there are a lot of people that use NumberFire for their
 Daily Fantasy Sports projections, so I do not have a leg up on anyone.
